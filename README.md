Virtualization - Virtual Private Cloud using Azure
Aim :
To design and implement a secure, scalable, and highly available Azure Virtual Network (VNet) infrastructure that enables seamless communication between cloud-based resources and on-premises systems, while ensuring compliance with organizational security and networking standards.

Problem Statement :
Modern cloud applications need secure, isolated, and scalable networks for reliable communication and data protection. Without a properly configured Azure Virtual Network (VNet), resources face security risks and connectivity issues. Organizations struggle to design networks that meet performance, security, and compliance needs.

Design Steps :
Sign in to the Azure Portal Navigate to https://portal.azure.com and log in with your Azure account credentials.

Result :
A secure and scalable Azure Virtual Network (VNet) was implemented, enabling isolated communication between cloud resources. Integration with on-premises infrastructure was achieved via a VPN gateway, with security enforced through Network Security Groups (NSGs). The network met performance, accessibility, and compliance standards, resulting in a production-ready environment.
